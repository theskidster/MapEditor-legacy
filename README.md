# MapEditor

I don't anticipate ever using this again outside of my current game project once its finished, so if you we're looking for something with dedication and upkeep like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), this ain't it!

That being said, I decided to open source it from the start just in case anybody wants to play around in the code.

Enjoy!



## IMPORTANT:

Remember to include the freetype26MT_x64.dll file (located in this projects lib folder) in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.1\bin otherwise it wont work.



TODO: create installer that solves this.
